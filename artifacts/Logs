meet and setup the environments.

8/29/24
planned what algorithms and divided the work
Luis- merge.
Spencer- Quick sort.
Rajat- Selection sort.

9/03/24
planned optimization
Luis- Recursive into threads.
Spencer- Dynamic partition and assign to threads. 
Rajat- Remove coppying of elements.

9/5/24
Tested algorithms without optimization and updated makefile for getting files.

9/10/24
Figured out code to graph the performance of the algorithms.
finished optimizing the code. 
started assigning ranges for different algorithms.
